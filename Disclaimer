Simulation for redox-active Film based Photoelectrodes
 Version: 1.00 	[bug reports to thomas.hoefer@rub.de] 

This software can be used to simulate photoelectrodes based on redox-active films (mediated electron transfer). Different models can be 
selected under "Choose appropriate Model" or "Menu -> Model (Ctrl + M)". The simulation is only valid under various assumptions, please 
check the publication below (Open access) to find out if one of the models fit for your system. This paper could serve as a general 
literature citation when the PECSim software is employed for the simulation of redox-active film based biophotoelectrodes:
